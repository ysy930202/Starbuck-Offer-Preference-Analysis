## 1. Project Motivation

This project is the Capstone project of my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity. As a Starbucks lover and interested into Starbucks offers, I took the Starbucks Capstone Challenge to better understand user preference toward Starbucks offers.

In this project, I use data to investigate two questions:
 
   1) What are the main drivers of an effective offer on he Starbucks app?
   2) Could the data provided, namely offer characteristics and user demographics, predict whether a user would take up an offer?

To answer questions, I created 3 models for the data on the 3 offer types: Buy One Get One Free (BOGO), Discount (discount with purchase), and Informational (provides information about products).

## 2. Summary of Results

1) The feature importance given by all 3 models illustrate that the tenure of a member, income and age are the three important predictor of the effectiveness of an offer. 

2) 3 separate models are used to predict the effectiveness of each offer type ended up with good accuracy for the 2 of the models (83.3%for BOGO and 86.9% for discount), while slightly less accurate performance for another informational offers (76.1%)
